Feature: Viewing tickets
	In order to view the tickets for a project
	As a user
	I want to see them on that project's page

	Background:
		Given there are the following users:
			| email 				| password |
			| user@ovia.in 	| password |
		And I am signed in as them
	  	Given there is a project called "TextMate 2"
		And "user@ovia.in" can view the "TextMate 2" project
	  	And "user@ovia.in" has created a ticket for this project:
	    	| title           | description                   |
	    	|  Make it shiny! | Gradients! Starbursts! Oh my! |

	  And there is a project called "Internet Explorer"
	  And "user@ovia.in" can view the "Internet Explorer" project
	  And "user@ovia.in" has created a ticket for this project:
	    	| title                | description   |
	    	| Standards compliance | Isn't a joke. |

	  And I am on the homepage
		And I follow "Projects"

    When I follow "TextMate 2"
    Then I should see "Make it shiny!"
    And I should not see "Standards compliance"
    When I follow "Make it shiny!"
    Then I should see "Make it shiny" within "#ticket h2"
    And I should see "Gradients! Starbursts! Oh my!"
